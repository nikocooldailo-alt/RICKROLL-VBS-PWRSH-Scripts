# PowerShell Rickroll Prank Scripts

This repository contains a harmless, ethical Rickroll prank for Windows. The scripts include:

- **rickrollanimation.ps1**: A PowerShell script that displays an animated ASCII Rick Astley dancing across the console window.
- **rickroll.vbs**: A simple VBScript launcher for easy double-click execution of the PowerShell animation.

## Features
- Fully unobfuscated, readable code—no encoded payloads or suspicious behavior.
- Designed to avoid antivirus triggers and false positives.
- No downloads, no malware, and no system modifications.
- Intended for fun, legal pranking among friends and colleagues.

## How it works
The PowerShell script displays an animated ASCII Rick Astley, while the VBS launcher makes it easy to run the prank. Both files are safe and transparent, perfect for sharing a laugh without any risk.

## Usage
1. Place both `rickrollanimation.ps1` and `rickroll.vbs` in the same folder.
2. Double-click `rickroll.vbs` to launch the animation.
3. (Optional) Create a shortcut to the VBS file, change its icon, and hide the original files for a more convincing prank.

This prank is intended for ethical, legal fun only. Always get permission before running scripts on someone else's computer. Enjoy responsibly and always prank ethically!
